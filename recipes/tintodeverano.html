    <h3>The most refreshing way to drink wine</h3>
    <p>Easy to make and absolutely delicious, you can't miss with this cool take on wine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>These are the portions for one drink, so multiply accordingly for the number of people!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Four ounces of red wine</li>
        <li>Eight ounces of lemon soda (e.g.: 7up, Sprite, etc.) or club soda</li>
        <li>Two to three lemon slices</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a tall glass or mason jar with ice, leaving some room at the top.</li>
        <li>Add in the lemon slices. If you are using lemon soda over club soda, you can switch it up and use orange slices instead, but lemon is a classic.</li>
        <li>Add the wine and top it up with the soda. We recommend a 1:2 wine to soda ratio, but you can add more wine to make it boozier if you'd like. No judgement here ;)</li>
        <li>Stir and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
